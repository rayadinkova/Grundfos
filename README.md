1st semester project - Busness Academy Aarhus

Grundfos Kollegiet is a newly built student dormitory near the city centre of Aarhus, for which me and a group of 4 fellow designers, developed a digital solution for the dormitory's infoscreen.

<h3>Design process:</h3>
<h4>Double diamond framework</h4>
<ul>

**Discover** - interviews and observations, competition research, market research

**Define** - mapping, user profile, list of values, list of requirements

**Develop** - sketches, mood board, idea development

**Deliver** - low and high fidelity wireframing, testing

</ul>

<h3>Methods and design principles used:</h3>

<p>Methods</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interview guide</li>
  <li>User persona</li>
  <li>HMW</li>
  <li>User flow</li>
  <li>Interaction design(Low fidelity/Hight fidelity wireframes)</li>
  <li>User testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Principles</p>
<p>To make the design support the usability and readability, several Gestalt principles are included in the solution. In the navigation bar we used proximity (icons are close to each other) and similarity (icon that is chosen has a different background colour than the other icons). Closure principle is visible on our frontpage, the triangles show the user where to click to get to different pages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gestalt laws</li>
  <li>60/30 design principle</li>
</ul>
